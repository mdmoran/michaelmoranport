  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img id="portfolioPicture" alt="Michael Moran" src="pictures/michael%20moran-about.jpg" width="250px" height="357px">
    
  <p>My name is Michael Moran, and I am currently attending Kansas State's Polytechnic University, majoring in Computer Systems Technology. I chose to attend K-State Polytechnic for the hands-on experience learning they provide to their entire student population. I also grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, the home of the main Kansas State Campus, which made my transition of becoming a K-State student all the easier.</p>
    <h4>Why study computers?</h4>
        <p>When I attended middle school, I had a group of friends who wanted to play video games with me. The issue with this was: they wanted to play PC games, and I had no PC, let alone one that could run games reliably. I started to do research on gaming PC's and I became instantly fascinated. Once I was able to acquire my very own computer, I took every chance I had to learn more about it. I started taking classes about basic programming and computer use. I instantly knew that working with computers was what I wanted to do for a living. This led me to searching for colleges with computer focused majors and eventually to K-State Polytechnic.</p>
    <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>I currently work as an IT student worker on the K-State Polytechnic Campus, assisting faculty, staff and students with everyday technical issues such as network connections, hardware and software maintenance and replacement, as well as a variety of other computer related tasks.</p>
    <h4>What do you do in your spare time?</h4>
        <p>I consider myself a huge nerd. It has already been said that I play video games, of which I play on multiple systems, but I also play numerous board games as well. These games include Magic: the Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons among many other games. I was also in school choirs so I like to listen to music of many genres, and enjoy singing along as well.</p>
