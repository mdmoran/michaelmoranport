  <h2>About Me</h2>
    
  <p>My name is Michael Moran, and I am currently finishing up my freshmen year at Kansas State's Polytechnic University, majoring in Computer Systems Technology. I chose to attend K-State Polytechnic for the hands-on experience learning they advertised so heavily on my search for colleges. I wanted to be able to do what I love, working with computers, right out of school. I also grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, the home of the main Kansas State Campus, which made my transition of becoming a K-State student all the easier.</p>
    <h4>Why study computers?</h4>
        <p>When I attended middle school, I had a group of friends who wanted to play games with me. The issue with this was: they wanted to play PC games, and I had no PC, let alone one that could run games reliably. My family and I did not have the money or the knowledge at the time to buy a PC, so I started looking into computers. I became instantly fascinated. Every chance I got to be on a computer I took. This eventually led me to join a coding club offered by my middle school. I got my first job the summer after my last year of middle school, and I immediately began to save as much money as I could to buy my very own PC. I kept true to what my goal was, and searched for computers and parts that would be good gaming PC parts. By my freshman year of highschool, I was playing games on my very own gaming PC. I instantly knew that working with computers was what I wanted to do for a living. This led me to searching for colleges with computer focused majors.</p>
    <h4>What do you do in your spare time?</h4>
        <p>I consider myself a huge nerd. It has already been said that I play video games, of which I play on multiple systems/consoles, but I also play numerous board games as well. These games include Magic: the Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons (of which I actually help produce a podcast) among many other games. I was also in choir for most of my middle school, and all of my high school years, so I very much like to listen to music of many genres, and enjoy singing along as well.</p>
