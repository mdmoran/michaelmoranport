    <h2>With the Formalities Out of the Way...</h2>
    
    <p>Here are some things about me. I grew up in Manhattan, Kansas always surrounded by the Kansas State Wildcats. I took an interest in computers in middle school, joining the coding club my school offered in 8th grade. In the summer after my 8th grade year, I got my first job. The first thing I did was save up enough money to build my very own PC, focusing the specs on gaming. By my freshman year of high school I had built my own computer and still enjoyed working on and with it throughout high school. Knowing that I wanted to work with computers as a career, I started looking at many colleges, eventually setting my eyes on Kansas State's Polytechnic University, where I am currently enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology major. </p>
    
    <h2>What Have You Done with Computers?</h2>
    
    <p>I am still early on in my college career, currently finishing up my freshmen year. As a result, my project library is not as large as I would like it to be. However, I am still working to create more and update my portfolio as much as possible. A short list of projects I have completed is: this website, another website I created for a podcast that I help produce, created a short arcade game with JavaScript using P5.js, and several projects with various photo and video editors.
