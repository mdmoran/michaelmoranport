    <p>This site is a collection of projects that I have worked on in either personal time or in school. The projects involve work with coding languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. In addition to these, I have some experience with Python as well. I also have knowledge using media editing software such as Adobe's Creative Cloud programs.</p>
