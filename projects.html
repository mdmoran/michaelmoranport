                    <td>I am part of a group of friends that like to play a RPG board game, Dungeons and Dragons. We wanted to share our experiences playing the game and decided to create a podcast. An assignment of mine was also to make my first website. I talked with my friends and used this opportunity to create a website for the group.

                    <td>Using the web editor for p5.js, I used JavaScript to create a small arcade game where the goal is to stop the zombies from reaching the bottom of the screen.

                    <td>My first project with JavaScript, I thought it would be fun to see what I could do with minimal skills. After a few class sessions in my programming class during my first freshman semester, I set out to make a simple drawing program. It comes with a few select colors to choose from, a brush thickness slider, and also erases with a press of the space bar.

                    <td>One of my latest video editing projects, this video was created as an assignment to prepare my class for a research project we had to create, which was to be shared as a video.

                    <td>This video was my first video project using existing video clips. The assignment was created to allow us to learn how to borrow clips for the purpose of compilation projects.

I chose to create a montage of funny moments from one of my favorite characters, Inosuke, from Kimetsu No Yaiba: Demon Slayer.

                    <td>Working with media editing tools was a goal created by an instructor of mine in my first semester of college. To get familiar witht he software, we were given an assignment to create a photo using several stock images provided with the theme being "the fall season." We were allowed to be as creative as we wanted, so I decided to create a funny meme picture, dipicting picking a pumpkin as the same as finding your child. This piece was created using Adobe Photoshop. You can see a full picture <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>!</td>

                    <td>Another early Adobe Photoshop project, I was tasked with swapping the heads of two characters. I chose Banjo and Kazooie, my choice being mainly due to personal reasons as I had been playing as Banjo and Kazooie in Super Smash Bros Ultimate a lot at the time. I was unable to fix the color schemes on the characters, but that was not required for the assignment.

                    <td>My freshmen year of college, I took the class Mastering Academic Conversations, which focused on improving skills necessary for college, including writing practices, leadership activities, and group work, among other things.
