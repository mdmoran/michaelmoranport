            <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
            <p>I had an issue at the beginning of development that the stroke would draw over the buttons. There also was a problem with the code breaking on initial draw if there wasn't a color already selected (only occurred on start up). Both issues have been fixed.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>Learned basics of buttons and how to debug JavaScript code.</p>
            <h3>Tools and/or Software Used</h3>
            <p>This was all created using:<ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>p5.js Web Editor</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Add more tools if possible, such as: undo button or a color-selector wheel rather than buttons with set colors.</p>
