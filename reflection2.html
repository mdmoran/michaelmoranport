            <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
            <p>Acquiring a usable zombie image was difficult and none of the photos would load in correctly for me. With the help of a friend we were able to solve the issue using a media editing software. The leveling system was also difficult upon attempt, as I had never done it before and it was brand new to me.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>How to make a basic game using JavaScript and how to debug the code associated with it.</p>
            <h3>Tools and/or Software Used</h3>
            <p>This was all created using:<ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>p5.js Web Editor</li><li>GIMP</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>I plan to revisit this project to make it better. This would include a responsive screen size and a "play again" button, which I also had trouble with.</p>
