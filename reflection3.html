            <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
            <p>This project was challenging at first, but in the end it was only a simple logic error that was causing an item addition error.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>I quickly learned the use of .txt files and how to use JavaScript to pull data from them. It was also useful to learn the basics of item selection for future reference.</p>
            <h3>Tools and/or Software Used</h3>
            <p>This was all created using:<ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>Rep.it Live Editor</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>This project works as it is intended, so there is not much to do next. I'd like to be able to incorporate the code into something later on, but I have not had the opportunity to do so.</p>
