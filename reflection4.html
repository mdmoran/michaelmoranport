            <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
            <p>Occasionally data will not correctly delete from the database. This issue did not seem to occur every time.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>I learned how to use JavaScript to create, find, edit, and delete data from a database.</p>
            <h3>Tools and/or Software Used</h3>
            <p>This was all created using:<ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>Rep.it Live Editor</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>This project works as it is intended, so there is not much to do next. I'd like to be able to incorporate the code into something later on, but I have not had the opportunity to do so.</p>
