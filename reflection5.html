            <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
            <p>Most of the challenges occurred towards the beginning of development. Once we were able to secure a live development server and manage our resources, the project went along smoothly. There were some difficulties in communication, but not enough to derail the teams.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>Teamwork is very important and communication is key. When taking on big projects, it is good to divide and conquer in some cases and spread out the responsibility. Communication is required for these projects to work as intended.</p>
            <h3>Tools and/or Software Used</h3>
            <p>This was all created using:<ul><li>Wordpress</li><li>phpMyAdmin</li><li>Elementor</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>This project is complete and is live at site name here.</p>
